        <b><u>Features Of Java:-</u></b><br><br>
        <b> &rArr; </b> Java is a general-purpose programming language developed with the aim to bring portability and a higher level of security. Other than these two main java features, there are many other features of Java that make it such a unique and popular language. <br><br>

        <b> List of features of Java programming languages :- </b> <br> <br>

        <b> 1. Simplicity :- </b> Java is a very simple language as it is derived from C++ and C. So a user who has learned the C and C++ programming can easily do it by learning basic Java syntax. <br>
        Java removes the features, which were not used and created confusion too. There is also a facility for automatic garbage collection in Java so that you don’t have to delete unreferenced objects. <br> <br>

        <b> 2. Object-Oriented :- </b> Java is an Object-oriented language as it modeled around ‘objects’ rather than on the ‘process’. Object-oriented programming has the following concepts that the Java language also has- <br>
        1. Classes <br>
        2. Objects & Methods <br>
        3. Inheritance <br>
        4. Polymorphism <br>
        5. Abstraction <br>
        6. Encapsulation <br> <br>

        <b> 3. Platform Independence :- </b> Java is a platform independent language, that means we can directly execute java on any platform but that platform should have valid JVM installed. <br>
        Java can run on multiple platforms as the program written is compiled and then the bytecodes generated is platform-independent code, Java offers the feature “Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA)”. <br> <br>

        <b> 4. Security :- </b> Java is known to be such a secure language because of the following features – <br>
        1. Java has no explicit pointer. <br>
        2. Programs are run in a virtual machine sandbox. <br>
        3. Java adds a class loader which separates the classes for a package of the local file system from imported ones from a network. <br>
        4. It has a bytecode verifier which checks the code fragments for any illegal code that violate the access right. <br>
        5. It as a security manager that defines the access for Java classes. <br> <br>

        <b> 5. Robustness :- </b> Java is a robust language i.e. a strong language. It uses a strong memory management, the lack of pointers helps in security issues, an automatic garbage collection, exception handling and also type checking mechanism which in all makes it a very strong language. <br> <br>

        <b> 6. Neutral Java Architecture :- </b> In Java, codes are compiled and thus bytecodes are generated. These bytecodes can run on any computer architecture thus making Java architecture neutral. <br> <br>

        <b> 7. Portability :- </b> Java is a highly portable language as the bytecodes can be carried to any platforms. <br> <br>

        <b> 8. High performance :- </b> Java offers high performance due to its bytecodes, it is faster than any interpreted language. Java architecture is designed to reduce overheads during runtime. <br> <br>

        <b> 9. Distributed Applications :- </b> Java can create distributed applications using RMI and EJB. This feature of Java facilitates the user to call any file by calling any method on any computer. <br> <br>

        <b> 10. Multi-Threading :- </b> A thread in any language is a different program that runs concurrently, this feature helps Java to handle multiple tasks simultaneously. Threads don’t occupy memory, it works on memory sharing. <br> <br>

        <b> 11. Dynamics :- </b> Java is a dynamic language which means it can link new Java class libraries, Java objects, and Java methods dynamically. It also supports functions from its native languages such as C and C++. <br> <br>

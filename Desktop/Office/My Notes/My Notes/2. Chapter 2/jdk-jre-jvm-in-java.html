        <b> &rArr; JDK (Java Development Kit) :- </b> JDK contains tools needed to develop the java programs. The tools include java compiler (javac.exe), java application launcher (java.exe), java web (javaw.exe), appletviewer, java documentation (javadocs.exe) and many more. <br>
        JDK is mainly targeted for java development i.e. we can create java file (with the help of java packages), compile a java file and run the java file. <br>
        <b>JDK = JRE + Development Tools</b> <br> <br>

        <b> &rArr; JRE (Java Runtime Environment) :- </b> JRE contains JVM (Java Virtual Machine), class libraries and other supporting files. It does not contain any development tools like compiler, debugger etc. <br>
        If you need to run java program, you need to have JRE installed in your system. <br>
        <b> JRE = JVM + Java Package Classes + Runtime Libraries</b> <br> <br>

        <b> &rArr; JVM (Java Virtual Machine) :- </b> JVM is an abstract machine. It provides runtime environment(or say virtual machine) in which java bytecode can be executed. <br>
        JVM is available for many hardware and software platforms. JVM is platform dependent because configuration of each OS differ and this makes java platform independent. <br>
        JVM performs following major tasks :- <br>
        <b>1. Loads Java Class </b> <br>
        <b>2. Verifies java code </b> <br>
        <b> 3. Allocates memory to variables(local, instance and static variables), current running methods etc </b> <br>
        <b> 4. Executes the code </b> <br> <br>

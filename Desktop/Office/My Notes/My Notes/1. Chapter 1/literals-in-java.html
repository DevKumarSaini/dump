        <b><u>Literals In Java:-</u></b><br><br>
        <b> &rArr; Definition :- </b> A Literal is a sequence of characters (digits, letters, and other characters) that represent constant values to be stored in variables or simply say, the value assigned to a variable is known as literal. <br><br>
        For example:
        <div class="codediv">
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        <br> <keywords>int</keywords> a=10;    <comments>// here "10" is literal</comments>
                        <br> <keywords>char</keywords> c='a';    <comments>// here "a" is literal</comments>
                        <br> <keywords>String</keywords> name="deepak";    <comments>// here "deepak" is literal</comments>

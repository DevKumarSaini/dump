        <b><u>Data Types In Java:-</u></b><br><br>
        <b> &rArr; Definition :- </b> The type of data that we stored in the variable is known as Data Type. <br><br>
        For example:
        <div class="codediv">
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        <br> <keywords>int</keywords> a=10;    <comments>// here "int" is data type</comments>
                        <br> <keywords>char</keywords> c='a';    <comments>// here "char" is data type</comments>
                        <br> <keywords>String</keywords> name="deepak";    <comments>// here "String" is data type</comments>
                    </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <br>

        <br> <b> &rArr; According to Data types, languages can be divided into two categories :- </b> <br> <br>
        <b> 1. Statically Typed Language : </b> In this type of languages, each variable and expression type is already known at compile time. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain data type, it cannot hold values of other data types. <br>
        For Example: C, C++, Java, FORTRAN, Pascal, Scala etc <br><br>
        <b> 2. Dynamically Typed Languages: </b> In this type of languages we need not to specify the type of data or variable, it is automatically checked during run-time. <br>
        For Example: Objective-C, PHP, Python, JavaScript, Ruby, Lisp etc <br><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; Difference Between Primitive and Non-Primitive Data Types :- </b><br><br>
        1. The size of Primitive data type is fixed i.e. if we declare <b>int a=10;</b> or <b> int a=1000; </b>, in both cases int data type will take 4 byte of memory. <br>
        But The size of non-primitive data type is not fixed for eg. <b> int[] a=new int[3];</b> in this case array will take 12 byte of memory but if we declare <b> int[] a=new int[4];</b> in this case array will take 16 byte of memory, thus size of array is not fixed. <br> <br>
        2. Primitive data type are building blocks but non-primitive data types are derived from primitive data types. <br><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; Types Of Data Types :-</b><br><br>
        <i id="font">There are two types of Data Types:-</i><br><br>
        <b> 1. Primitive Data Types :- </b>
        <i>Primitive types are the most basic data types available within the Java language. The size of all primitive data types are fixed. <br>
            There are 8 primitive data types which are as follows :<br>
            <b>boolean, byte, char, short, int, float, long, double</b> <br>
        </i><br>
        <b> 2. Non-Primitive Data Types or Derived Data Types :- </b>
        <i> Non-Primitive data types are derived from primitive data types. The size of non-primitive data types are not fixed. <br>
            Following are non-primitive data types :<br>
            <b>String, array, class, structures, unions etc</b> <br>
        </i><br>

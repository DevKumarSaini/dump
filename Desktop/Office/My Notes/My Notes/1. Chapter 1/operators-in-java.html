        <b><u>Operators In Java:-</u></b><br><br>
        <b> &rArr; Definition :- </b> Operators are the special symbols which perform any operation on one or more operands. <br><br>
        For example:
        <div class="codediv">
            <pre>
                    <code>
                        <br> <keywords>int</keywords> a=10, b=20;    <comments>// here "=" is an assignment operator</comments>
                        <br> <keywords>int</keywords> c=a+b;    <comments>// here "=" and "+" is an assignment and arithmetic operators respectively, and "a" and "b" are operands</comments>
                        <br> c++;    <comments>// here "++" is an increment operator which perform operation on one operand i.e. "c"</comments>
                    </code>
            </pre>
        </div>

        <br> <b> &rArr; Types Of Operators :- </b> <br> <br>
        <b> 1. Arithmetic Operator </b>  <br><br>
        <b> 2. Assignment Operator </b> <br><br>
        <b> 3. Relational Operator </b> <br><br>
        <b> 4. Logical Operator </b>  <br><br>
        <b> 5. Bitwise Operator </b> <br><br>
        <b> 6. Ternary Operator </b> <br><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; 1. Arithmetic Operator :- </b><br><br>
        <i> Arithmetic operators are used in mathematical expression in the same way that they are used in algebra.</i><br/><br/>
        Below is the list of all arithmetic operators :- <br>
        <b> Assume integer variable "a=10" and "b=20", then...</b><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; 2. Assignment Operator :- </b><br><br>
        <i> The assignment operator (=) is most common used operator in java. It evaluates the operand on the right hand side and then assigns the resulting value to a variable on the left hand side. The right operand can be a variable, constant, function call or expression. The type of right operand must be type compatible with the left operand. </i><br/><br/>
        Below is the list of all assignment operators :- <br>
        <b> Assume integer variable "a", "b" and "c", then...</b><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; 3. Relational Operator :- </b><br><br>
        <i> A relational operator compares two values and determines the relationship between them.</i><br/><br/>
        Below is the list of all relational operators :- <br>
        <b> Assume integer variable "a=10" and "b=20", then...</b><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; 4. Logical Operator :- </b><br><br>
        <i> A logical operator (sometimes called a "Boolean Operator") is an operator that returns a boolean result that's based on the boolean result of one or two other expressions.</i><br/><br/>
        Below is the list of all logical operators :- <br>
        <b> Assume integer variable "a=true" and "b=false", then...</b><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; 5. Bitwise Operator :- </b><br><br>
        <i> Bitwise operators operate on individual bits of integer types (long, int, short, char, byte). If an operand is shorter than an int, it is promoted to int before doing the operations</i><br/>
        <i>It helps to know how integers are represented in binary. For example the decimal number 3 is represented as 11 in binary and the decimal number 5 is represented as 101 in binary.</i><br/><br>
        Below is the list of all bitwise operators :- <br>
        <b> Assume integer variable "a=60" and "b=13", then...</b><br>

        <br><b> &rArr; 6. Ternary Operator :- </b><br><br>
        <i> Ternary operator is used as one liner replacement for if-then-else statement. It is the only conditional operator which takes three operands and hence the named ternary.</i><br/><br/>
        Below is the syntax of ternary operator :- <br>
        <div class="codediv">
            <pre>
                <code>
                    <br> <b> condition ? if true : if false </b>
                </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
        <b>  </b><br>
        <b> Working of above operator : </b>
        If the condition evaluates to true, then the statements after the ‘?’ will execute else the statements after the ‘:’ will execute. <br> <br>
        <b> Below is the program to find the greater number between two numbers using ternary operator : </b> <br>
        <div class="codediv">
            <pre>
                    <code>
    <keywords>class </keywords>Test
    {
    <keywords>      int</keywords> a=10, b=20;
    <keywords>      int</keywords> result=(a>b) ? a : b;
          System.out.println("Greater of two numbers is : "+result);
    }
    
    <comments>//Output is : Greater of two numbers is : 20</comments>
                    </code>
            </pre>
        </div> <br> <br>
        
        <b> Another program to find the greater number between three numbers using ternary operator : </b> <br>
        <div class="codediv">
            <pre>
                    <code>
    <keywords>class </keywords>Test
    {
    <keywords>      int</keywords> a=10, b=20, c=30;
    <keywords>      int</keywords> result=((a > b) ? (a > c) ? a : c : (b > c) ? b : c);
          System.out.println("Greater of three numbers is : "+result);
    }
    
    <comments>//Output is : Greater of three numbers is : 30</comments>
                    </code>
            </pre>
        </div>
